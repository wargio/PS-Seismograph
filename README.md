PS Seismograph - a simple seismograph for PS3
=============================================

This is a simple Seismograph for ps3. it uses all the axis of the first controller.
it uses 1920x1080 resolution, so i don't know if it will ever work on SD tv.
Anyway i hope this can show how people can use PSL1GHT SDK
